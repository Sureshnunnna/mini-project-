Handling the space (' ') operator case:
The space character ' ' isn't really an operator, and it seems like you're trying to compute the square root when the space character is used. This may not be a great design, and if you intended to allow square root, you might want to explicitly use a different operator, such as 's' or 'r' for square root.
2. Handling division by zero:
You should check whether the second number (valueTwo) is zero when performing division to avoid a runtime error (division by zero).
3. Output formatting:
The printf statement is trying to print the operator between the two numbers even when the operator doesn't apply to both (like square root), so you may want to handle cases like square root separately.
4. General clarity:
Use clear control flow and avoid unnecessary goto statements unless absolutely necessary.
